Trimmed criteria:

AIM: Write control software for 'SLED1'.

- Read in two files (map.txt and sledcommands.txt)
- Use intstructions in the commands file to navigate SLED1 around the map.
- To read files use fscanf()

THE MAP FILE

- Map is stored in a two-dimentional array declared as char map [30] [30]
- Map is initialised so that there is a '.' in each location.
- 0,0 is bottom left and 29,29 is top right.

- The map file consists of 0 or more lines and they have ther format: x-coordinate, y-coordinate, symbol.

Key:
'.' (empty),
'P' (parkland),    	9,9,H
'S' (street), 	This indicates that at the coordinate 9,9 there is a house.
'H' (house), 
'T' (tower), 
'F' (factory),
'U' (university).

THE COMMAND FILE

- Also consists of 0 or more lines and they have the format: command command-value
**(command is a string that can initially be either FORWARD or TURN
command_value is an integer) e.g. FOWARD 90, TURN 90, FOWARD 20.
 NOTE: We can only make turns of 0, 90, 180 or 270 degrees.


THE PROGRAM

Write a program that can navigate SLED1 aroudn the mpa specified in the map file according to the instructions supplied in the command file.
You should store all the infomation about SLED1 in a structure of the following type. DECLARED AT START OF PROGRAM AFTER INCLUDES AND DEFINES but before any functions.

struct sled {
    int  x,
         y,
         orientation,
         totalDistance;
};
