For your assessed work you will need to develop a program in C that helps santa and his elves!  

You'll want to read the problem set very carefully for the specification!

Although it might seem intimidating, there are definitely 'steps' in difficulty throughout, 
and once you have one feature done & tested, move onto the next - aim to get as far as you can before week 10.  

Definitely aim to arrive at next week's lab with working code as complete as you're able!

There's lots of help available.  But please - to remind you all - this should be your own, 
and not group work - it's designed to test your understanding and that's the important thing in the learning process!  

We will be running plagiarism detection software as part of the two stage submission process!


The best preparation is the previous week's tasks, which introduces many of the same logical patterns and functions you'll need. 

The more sections of this you complete, the more you'll be able to answer, 
but you should be able to pass with good course knowledge and the key program elements.  

So don't panic!
